# DAB Live! for Home Assistant
An Home Assistant custom integration for DAB Live!

## Use case
As of the writing of these README, there isn't an official way to integrate DAB Live! with Home Assistant or Siri.
The idea behind this project is to provide a simple way to enable functions like power shower and consumptions monitoring.

## Installation
Just add this repository to HACS and add your integration to Home Assitant.
